	* Another cool change (Did the PostgreSQL report make it?)

v0.44.0   2016-09-19 11:30:03-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Changed the fatal behaviour (back) to fail after logging instead of before
		This means the failure doesn't happen until it leaves the buffer either.
	+ Upgraded these three simple classes to Moose clases so log instantiation behaviour would be consistent
		Log::Shiras::Report::Stdout, Log::Shiras::Report::Test2Note, Log::Shiras::Report::Test2Diag
	! Fixed the missing clone method in the ~::Telephone for the 'ask' key

	+ Increased the level of die reporting in 01-csv.t in order to troubleshoot some CPAN testers fails

v0.37.13  2016-09-10 07:52:30-07:00 America/Los_Angeles 

	(cumulative since v0.30.0)
	! Block unicore/* scrubbing in ~::Unhide
	! Fixed for 04-telephone.t  failing in perl 5.16 and 5.18

v0.30.0   2016-09-09 14:20:26-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Updated version numbers for an initial CPAN release

v0.29_1   2016-09-09 14:03:12-07:00 America/Los_Angeles (TRIAL RELEASE)

	+ The goal is to create an initial CPAN release here
	+ This includes a substantial rework of the Unhide implementation
	+ Added line numbers to TapPrint and TapWarn namespace generation to allow for by-line control
	+ Substantially reworked the CSVFile report to consume arrayrefs and hashrefs rather than print lines
	+ Substantially reworked ShirasFormat Type to be an element modification class Log::Shiras::Report::MetaMethod
		I might take the ShirasFormat out altogether since it was too tricky for it's own good
