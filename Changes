	* Another cool change

v0.29_1   2016-09-09 14:03:12-07:00 America/Los_Angeles (TRIAL RELEASE)

	+ The goal is to create an initial CPAN release here
	+ This includes a substantial rework of the Unhide implementation
	+ Added line numbers to TapPrint and TapWarn namespace generation to allow for by-line control
	+ Substantially reworked the CSVFile report to consume arrayrefs and hashrefs rather than print lines
	+ Substantially reworked ShirasFormat Type to be an element modification class Log::Shiras::Report::MetaMethod
		I might take the ShirasFormat out altogether since it was too tricky for it's own good
